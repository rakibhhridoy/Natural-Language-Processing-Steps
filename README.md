##### Natural Language Processing Task is quite easy if you make your work clean and proceesed in order.

##### In this Repository you will find notbook that is well ordered for nlp task in Tensorflow 2.2.0. You will get:

``` 
Text Classification 
Text Sequence
```

If you donâ€™t have TensorFlow installed, Open Command Prompt & type the following:
```bash
pip install tensorflow
pip install tensorlflow== 2.2.0  #for version 2.2.0
```

In order to make task in a step, we have the following Steps:

```Text Classification```:

-	Senctence
-	Tokenize
-	Padded
-	Model Building
-	Feed the model/ Train the model
-	Validate the model
-	Embedding to Predicting
-	Download the Embedding and Project in TensorFlow Embedding System

 ```Text Sequence```:

-	Sentence
-	Tokenize 
-	Padded 
-	Labelling The Data
-	Model Building
-	Feed The Model
-	Validate The Model to Make Sequence of Word





###### Additionally You can find the scripts in ```Python``` to help easy and fast work.
